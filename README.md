# Hand-Written-Digit-Classification
For those of you new to this concept, CNN is a deep learning technique to classify the input automatically (well, after you provide the right data). Over the years, CNN has found a good grip over classifying images for computer visions and now it is being used in healthcare domains too. This indicates that CNN is a reliable deep learning algorithm for an automated end-to-end prediction. CNN essentially extracts ‘useful’ features from the given input automatically making it super easy for us!
